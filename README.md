# Customer-Churn-Prediction
# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn – when customers stop using a service – using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, the project aims to provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies for businesses.

## Objective
The main goals of this project are:

1. Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on behavioral data.
2. Identify key factors that influence churn rates.
3. Visualize trends and patterns to assist businesses in understanding customer behavior.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Telecom dataset from Kaggle
- **Description**: The dataset contains customer behavior data, including service usage, billing information, and demographics, which is used to predict churn likelihood.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Importing the telecom dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and insights using visualizations.
4. **Modeling**: Building a machine learning model to predict churn using the Random Forest algorithm.
5. **Evaluation**: Testing the model’s accuracy and performance.
6. **Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to showcase trends and key factors influencing churn.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and presentation

## Key Insights
- **At-Risk Customers**: Frequent service calls correlate with higher churn rates.
- **Plan Impact**: Customers with international plans are less likely to churn.
- **Regional Trends**: State-specific churn patterns offer opportunities for targeted retention strategies.

## Results
- The Random Forest model effectively predicts customer churn with high accuracy.
- Visualizations highlight significant trends and factors influencing churn, such as customer service interaction frequency and geographic differences.

## Future Scope
1. Explore other machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
2. Incorporate additional data, such as customer satisfaction surveys, for enhanced analysis.
3. Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor churn trends dynamically.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install required dependencies using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence to replicate the analysis.
4. Review the generated visualizations and model outputs.
